2. **Create Repository**:
   ```bash
   cd vercel-deployment
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "HPMREI secure dashboard"
   
   # Create new repository on GitHub (name it: hpmrei-dashboard)
   # Then connect it:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hpmrei-dashboard.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your `hpmrei-dashboard` repository
   - Click "Deploy" (takes 2-3 minutes)

### Phase 3: Security Configuration (5 minutes)

```
BACKEND_API_URL = https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io

```

**Optional - Restrict to Your IP Only**:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALLOWED_IPS = YOUR_IP_ADDRESS
```
(Find your IP at: [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com))
